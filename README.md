# Linear-Robotic-Fume-Tracker
A linear fume tracker is a system that tracks and removes hazardous fumes during welding. In this prototype, the fume extractor hood is represented by a small wooden block (follower), and the welding gun by a movable solid surface on a linear rail. The follower adjusts its position to maintain a constant distance for effective fume extraction.
